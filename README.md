# BookStoreApp
A BookStore class was designed that keeps a list of books and customers in a bookstore. A List ADT was used to store book titles, prices, and number of copies available. Incoming customers will be placed in a Queue ADT and service will be provided accordingly.The customers will store the customers names and the requested book in the queue. A Batch ADT was used to store new deliveries to the store, including book titles, prices, and number of copies delivered. For each class, appropriate accessor and update (add / remove / modify) methods are provided.
